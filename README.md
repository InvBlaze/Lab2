# SYSC 3010 Lab 2: Relational Databases and Integration Technologies

## Overview
This lab focuses on relational databases using SQLite on a Raspberry Pi, incorporating Python for database management and data visualization, and explores cloud database options. Students will also work with JSON and API integration to enhance their applications.

## Objectives
- Install and set up SQLite on Raspberry Pi.
- Learn SQL basics including creating tables, adding and querying data.
- Utilize Python to manage databases and visualize sensor data.
- Explore cloud database solutions like Firebase, MongoDB, and Supabase.
- Integrate JSON data structures with REST APIs.

## Setup Instructions
1. Install SQLite on your Raspberry Pi using provided tutorials.
2. Utilize the command-line interface or a GUI manager to handle databases.
3. Write Python scripts for inserting data into databases and visualizing it.

## Exercises
### Exercise 1: SQLite Command Line Interface
- Create your first database table using the SQLite CLI. Follow the [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-oOIRIhiQ) for installation and basic commands.

### Exercise 2: Database Managers (GUI)
- Install and explore a GUI database manager to simplify database interactions. Links to tutorials are provided in the lab document.

### Exercise 3: Inserting Data Using Python
- Develop a Python script to insert sensor data into the database. Ensure your script works by verifying data insertion.

### Exercise 4: Visualizing Data
- Use Python libraries like matplotlib or plotly to visualize database data through graphical representations.
